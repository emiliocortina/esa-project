                    Cooper is a mobile app that presents the data collected by satellites in a simple and undertandable
                    way
                    to the users. All of this data is related to climate change meassure factors. Cooper provides
                    different
                    parameters divided into multiple categories such as :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Temperatures</li>
                    <li>Pollution</li>
                    <li>Tide levels</li>
                    <li>Rain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Users will be able to research all this data related to the location they choose, having access to
                    an
                    historical of the variation and other useful aggregate functions such as the average or the
                    deviation.
                    Finally we provide a way to share this data and explain how it affects you, by creating a
                    <b>"Coop"</b>
                    that can be visualized in the explore tab or shared in social networks.

                Cooper is not a common "Climate change" platform. Our aim is not force you to make the first move, we
                don't
                have the right to do that. It's is the moment that you realise what's right and what's not, and you have
                the
                power to enforce the goverments to make a change. Cooper is just a source of reliable information,
                directly provided by the ESA satellites observations.

                A law
                in
                your city forbide the trafic in the center? Visit Cooper and see if it had a real impact. Factories have
                increased over the years, have a look at the historial of air pollution meassures.

            <h2>Now what?</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Keep on going, that's it! We've got the support of the ESA (European Space Agency) and we hope that soon
                more organizations join us on this adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are planning also to provide a tool for professionals to allow a deeper analysis of the data and also
                to
                be able to embed the Coops on your webpage, on a school work, on scientific papers and so on.
